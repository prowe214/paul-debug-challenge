			A Bit About Me <br/>
			<small>I'm a New York kid.  I graduated from the University of Maryland in 2013 with an English degree.  During college, my family and I built a cognitive development center for kids of all abilities.  After 4 years, I've moved out here to Boulder to pursue tech development, and couldn't be more excited to jump into this area that I'm truly passionate about.  </small>

		<p>
			Quick Facts <br/>
			<small>I live for sports and competition.  I love going to concerts.  I have a four month old puppy named Bucket.  I'm very social and love meeting new people.  I like to kick back outside with a beer or a whiskey on the top of a mountain.  In the winter I snowboard as often as I can, and in the summer I hike.  Dope dope swagger swagger yolo.</small>
